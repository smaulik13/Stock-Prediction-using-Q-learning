# Stock-Prediction-using-Q-learning
This is a project to predict stock recommendations 

## Assignment - 1 :
### Task:
    - To take 10 years weekly data for any 3 firms and predict their Adjusted Closing price using at least 5 different algorithms 
### Models Used: 
   - Used Linear Regression, Ridge Regression,  Regression, KNN Regression, Decision Tree Regression and Random Forest regression.
    
## Reinforcement learning :
  -One of the 3 ML paradigms
  -**Agent**: Learner and decision maker
  -**Environment**: Everything outside agent with which agent interacts
   -Agent interacts with environment to find itself in new scenario
   -Goal is to maximize a reward function over time

## Deep Q-learning :
 -This addresses the limitation of Q-learning.
 -Aim of DQN is to train a deep neural network to approximate the Q-value function and predict Q values of each state action pair.
 
 ## Assignment 2: 
 - To develop a DQN model and q-leanring agent to predict whether the stock price would go up,down or would remain sideways on the t^th day on the basis of given stock prices till (t-1)th day.
 ## Dataset : 
    -2009 January-2017 December data for training and then the 2018 January-2019 December data to do the test.
 ## Profit :
   - My agent earned a profit of Rs. 2332 on investment of Rs. 20000.
